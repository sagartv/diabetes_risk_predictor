              Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.(Source: <a href = "https://www.who.int/health-topics/diabetes">The World Health Organization</a>)

                This is A FLASK-based web application that predicts the likelihood of the user having diabetes or prediabetes based on the answers to a questionnaire.The model is trained on the Diabetes Health Risk Prediction dataset available on <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset?select=diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv">kaggle</a> that was compiled from 253,680 survey responses to the Center for Disease Control's (CDC)  Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS2015) in 2015. I balanced this dataset using SMOTEENN before feeding it into an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) Model  </p>
